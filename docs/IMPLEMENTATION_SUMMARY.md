- Set up basic user roles and permissions

### Phase 3: User Interface (Week 5-6)
- Build dashboard with PM overview
- Create PM calendar interface
- Implement work order management
- Add real-time updates with PubSub

### Phase 4: Data Migration (Week 7)
- Import data from Odoo using migration scripts
- Import legacy COGZ data
- Validate data integrity
- Set up production data

### Phase 5: Mobile & Production (Week 8)
